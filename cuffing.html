    <p class="cuffingtext">Cuffing your pants to match your shoe is a crucial step in planning an outfit and if it's done correctly, it could make your outfit really stand out from the rest. <br><br>
        There are many different ways you could style your pants to fit your outfit. The most common way is to cuff your pants at the bottom so that they sit perfectly on your shoes.<br><br>
        It is also important to note that you should try to match the color of your shoes with the color of your socks so that if they are visible, it would look neater.

                   <td><p>This is a very relaxed and calmer look for wearing pants with shoes. It involves not cuffing your pants and letting them rest comfortably on the base of your shoe. With this look, a casual outfit would fit perfectly. However, any formal looks may not work that well with this style.</p></td>
