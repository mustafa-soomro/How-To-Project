Be sure to slide the laces in the tongue loop when you reach the tongue. When you get to the top, tighten the laces and leave extra lace at the top for tying the shoe.</p></td>

                    <td><b>Bar Laced Look</b></td>
                    <td>This style leaves the laces in straight lines from one loop to the next instead of a crossing pattern. To achieve this look, start lacing your shoe from the bottom but lead the lace from one side to the opposite side instead of the opposite diagonal. The diagonal should be at under the top laces so that the top only shows the laces in straight lines.</td>

                    <td><b>Wrap-Around Laced Look (High Tops)</b></td>
                    <td>This style only works for high top shoes. This style is usually used for Converse Chuck Taylors or Chuck 70s, but it could work for any high top shoe. To achieve this look, lace the shoe up from the bottom to the top as you would in a factory style look. At the top, leave the last three holes open and wrap the lace from the diagonal side around the back of the shoe and then into the lace hole of the opposite side. Repeat the same step for the opposite lace. The last hole at the top should be left open. You should still be able to tie the shoe from the front as you would regulary.</td>

                    <td>Method 4:</td>
                    <td><b>Hidden Knot Laced Look</b></td>
                    <td>This is a very basic style for lacing shoes and is pretty simple. This style is very similar to the factory laced look, however, it hides the knot behind the tongue so that the front of the shoe has a clean crossing pattern with the laces. To achieve this look, lace the shoe as you would in a factory laced look. When you get to the top, bring the tongue of the shoe out and tie the extra lace behind the tongue. You should still have enough room to slide your foot out of the shoe, but it should also stay on your foot while walking. Feel free to combine this look with the bar laced look for an even more unique shoe!</td>
